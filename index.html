        <h2>Buffalo Chicken Wings</h2>
        <p>This extremely popular creation came out of a New York restaurant in the 60’s by Teressa Bellissimo, who
            covered them in her own special sauce and served them with a side of celery and blue cheese. Since then,
            Buffalo wings have become the quintessential game day food in the United States served at bars, restaurants
            or ordered as take out.</p>
        <p>Of COURSE this recipe includes serving them in a Blue Cheese Dressing (or Ranch dressing).</p>
        <p>These wings were not only a hit at the dinner table, they were ordered again the next day! Just when I
            thought this little experiment wouldn’t be well received!</p>

        <h2>How To Make Crispy chicken Wings</h2>
        <p>The magic ingredient to crispy wings without a lot of oil is aluminium free baking powder. It may sounds
            unappealing, but coating chicken wings in seasoned baking powder is what makes the skin super crispy. You
            won’t taste it in the end results, so long as you use aluminium-free. To be clear, make sure you use baking
            powder, NOT baking soda, because there is a big difference!</p>
        <p>You're going to pimp yours up with added flavours:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>You can also add a dash of Cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Toss them until they are coated evenly.</p>

        <h2>How Do You Cook Chicken Wings In The Oven?</h2>
        <p>After your chicken wings are coated, place aluminium foil on your baking sheet to catch any drippings, then arrange a wire rack over the top. Place your wings in an even layer to allow the heat to be evenly distributed.</p>
        <p>You’re then going to bake your chicken wings on a rack so the fat can drip off, creating ultra crispy wings all over.</p>
        <h2>How Long Does It Take to bake Chicken Wings</h2>
        <p>Chicken wings can take about 50 minutes or more to bake, flipping them halfway through cooking time to allow even crispness. Why so long? To allow the fat to render out from the chicken wings so that the skin crisps to a delicious golden brown.</p>

        <h2>How To Make Buffalo Sauce</h2>
        <p>To get the best baked buffalo wings, you're going to toss them in an incredible buffalo sauce, with just three ingredients!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frank's Original Red Hot Sauce</li>
            <li>Melted unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Honey or sugar (white or brown)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whisk it all together until combined, then pour the sauce ALL over your CRISPY baked wings and serve! So easy and no deep fryers or entire kitchens to clean up afterwards.</p>
        <h2>Serve Yo Buffalo Wangz</h2>
        <p>Serve your buffalo wings with blue cheese dip, ranch dipping sauce or a creamy garlic mayo. Don’t forget the celery and/or carrot sticks on the side! Game day has never looked so easy and so good!</p>
        <p>To serve wings as a family meal, we normally keep some separate without sauce so the kids can enjoy super crispy chicken wings. You can also dip theirs in bbq sauce or honey garlic butter sauce. A win-win!</p>
